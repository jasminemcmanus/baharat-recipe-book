# Baharat Recipe Book

Baharat Recipe Book is a single page HTML application featuring recipes that use the Middle Eastern spice blend, baharat. It was designed to accompany a Christmas gift (hopefully you can guess what the gift is), with a QR code to access the site for recommended recipes. The site was built with simple HTML and CSS and utilises mobile-first design, because it will primarily be accessed via a QR code and will therefore almost exclusively be viewed on a mobile device.
